Mobile app to get notification when a new grade is written into the "Karinthy Napló"

If the line above does not have a meaning to you, this repo is not for you. ;)

This app is created to make the life of the students easier by not having to check for their grades regurarly.
It works by using the GYIA code, because the simplicity of the mobile site makes parsing much easier and
the hardship of handling login and storing login data safelyy is vanished. Therefore this app can only see
the grades, teachers' notes and the hours one has missed.

If you have anything to improve, whether by having a code ready-to-pull or just an idea, feel free to contribute! :)
