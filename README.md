# KFGnaplo
### or KFGapp (Naplo & Stand-ins) on Google Play
Mobile app for Android devices to get notification when a new grade is written into the "Karinthy Napló" - now E-Kréta

If the line above does not have a meaning to you, this repo is not for you. ;)

This app is created to make the life of the students easier by not having to check for their grades regurarly.
It works by using the Tokens created from the E-Kréta usernames and passwords. With the introduction of the new grading system (that is not so good by the way), using the API most features of the napló are implemented to this project.
These include: Grades, Timetable, Absences.
Using the Karinthy-sites, the following are also included: Stand-ins and Events.

If you have anything to improve, whether by having a code ready-to-pull or just an idea, feel free to contribute! :)
Although the project had some non-beta, working releases, most git commits are a **beta** or **alpha** implementation of a feature, or not properly tested, but complete features!
> However, the latest commits of this repo usually contain important changes and bugfixes! (milestones having *R* or nothing in their names can be considered stable)
